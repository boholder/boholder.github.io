> Concealing your identity behind a handle is a juvenile and silly behavior characteristic of crackers, warez d00dz, and other lower life forms. Hackers don't do this; they're proud of what they do and want it associated with their real names. So if you have a handle, drop it. In the hacker culture it will only mark you as a loser.

[Eric S. Raymond](http://catb.org/~esr/) said the sentence above in his article *[How To Become A Hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)*.   
After reading this article, I decided to expose myself to the Internet. Here I am.

I'll use this website to share my work and reflections and tutorials and share...  
Well, okay, the theme is sharing and presentation.  

I hope that my sharing can inspire others, or other positive feelings.
